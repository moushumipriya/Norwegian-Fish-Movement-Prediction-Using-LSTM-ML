Norwegian Fish Movement Prediction Using LSTM & ML
🐟 Project Overview
This project predicts fish movement/count in three Norwegian coastal regions by analyzing environmental data such as water temperature, salinity, depth, and seasonality. The goal is to help sustainable fisheries management by forecasting fish presence trends using advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques.

🔍 Motivation
Norway's economy relies heavily on fisheries; sustainable management is vital.

Predicting fish movement reduces overfishing and supports ecological balance.

Combines domain knowledge with AI skills — perfect for Norwegian environmental & marine sectors.

📊 Dataset
Synthetic fish movement data from 3 Norwegian regions.

Features: Date, Region, Water Temperature, Salinity, Depth, Season (derived).

Target: Fish_Count (number of fish detected/moved).
Target: Predict Fish_Count For Next 7 days.
